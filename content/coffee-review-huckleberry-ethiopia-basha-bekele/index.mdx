## A Journey of Tropical Delights

As the brew cooled, the flavor profile continued to evolve and mesmerize. 🌺 The blueberry notes mellowed while luscious guava and passionfruit took center stage, coating my sensors in lush tropical splendor. Despite the intense fruitiness, the cup remained clean and structured, a true testament to the skill of the producers.

I found myself getting lost in this marvelous coffee, savoring each sip like a fine wine. 🍷 The sweet, juicy character hugged my palate as hints of maple syrup emerged, combining with the passionfruit for an outrageously delicious flavor mélange. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, whispers of watermelon snuck in as a refreshing finisher. 💦

## Origins of Quality

The tale of this extraordinary coffee began in the lush Sidama region of Ethiopia, famous for its distinctive heirloom varieties and masterful naturally processed lots. Basha Bekele, a dedicated farmer in the village of Shantawene, is part of a group focused on empowering individual growers to process and export their own harvests.

While many rely on centralized washing stations or co-ops, trailblazers like Basha take quality control into their own hands. From cherry selection to meticulous drying, this personal touch results in coffees that truly showcase their unique character and a sense of place.

## The Natural Allure

For the Huckleberry team, naturally processed Ethiopian gems like this were a gateway into the world of specialty coffee. As they describe, encountering those first brain-melting examples of intense fruit and complexity made it impossible to think of coffee as "just coffee" ever again.

While the roaster offers naturals from various origins, there is an undeniable magic when this meticulous processing method combines with Ethiopia's prized heirloom varieties. The dried fruit flavors become so pure, so amplified, that it's like tasting the very essence of the coffee cherries themselves. 🍒

Huckleberry has made naturally processed Ethiopians a core part of their menu for good reason. Few origins can match that intoxicating blueberry, strawberry, passionfruit, and grape intensity that the finest examples possess.

## Worth the Indulgence

At $23 for a [12oz bag](https://huckleberryroasters.com/collections/frontpage/products/ethiopia-basha-bekele-natural), the Basha Bekele isn't cheap, but it delivers such a singular taste experience that it's worth every penny. As you sip and get lost in the fruit kaleidoscope, you'll understand why Huckleberry considers these naturals among their most treasured and transformative offerings.

Whether you're a tried-and-true fan of that iconic Ethiopian natural magic or are just venturing into this style, the Basha Bekele is an absolute must-try. It combines all the blueberry jammy goodness we crave with vivid tropical overtones in one sunburst-vibrant, squeaky clean package. 🌈

## Final Recommendation

My final recommendation? Let this bombshell of a coffee blow your circuits in the best way possible. 💥 Set aside some quiet coffee time, dig into those intoxicating aromas and flavors, and I guarantee your perception of what coffee can be will never be the same.

I'll be savoring every last drop of my bag and eagerly awaiting the next mind-bending Ethiopian natural bomb that the masterful humans at Huckleberry unearth. If this is what their gateway drug tastes like, I'm fully ready to go down the rabbit hole! ☕️🐇
