## A Harmonious Balance of Funk and Finesse

The Ecuador El Sauce's unique flavor profile is the result of a harmonious marriage between traditional washed processing and a touch of experimental yeast inoculation. The latter, applied to approximately 15% of the lot, introduces a tantalizing funk that dances delightfully with the sweetness and clean notes of the washed coffees.

It's a delicate balance that Huckleberry Roasters have masterfully achieved, ensuring that the funk never overpowers but rather complements the coffee's inherent flavors. Each sip is a delightful adventure, with notes of fig jam, molasses, brown sugar, and freeze-dried strawberries melding together in a symphony of flavors that lingers pleasantly on the palate.

## A True Celebration of Ecuadorian Terroir

While the processing techniques employed in creating the Ecuador El Sauce are undoubtedly innovative, the true stars of this coffee are the hardworking smallholder farmers from the town of El Sauce in Ecuador's Loja Province. Their dedication to their craft and the unique terroir of the region shine through in every cup, offering a taste of the rich flavors that this part of the world can produce.

Huckleberry Roasters' commitment to sourcing exceptional coffees and supporting ethical and sustainable practices is evident in their partnership with The Coffee Quest and Capamaco Trading. By working closely with these organizations, they've been able to bring the unique flavors of El Sauce to our cups, while ensuring that the farmers responsible for this remarkable coffee are fairly compensated for their efforts.
