Coffee enthusiasts, prepare your taste buds for liftoff! Today, we're embarking on a flavor odyssey to the lush heights of Santa Barbara, Honduras, with Atomic Coffee's Marco Tulio Sabillon. This honey-processed gem is about to redefine your coffee experience with a sweetness so intense, it might just make your teeth ache (in the best way possible). Ready to dive into a cup that's more than just a beverage? It's a sweet, standout adventure!

## A Honeyed Hello

From the moment this coffee touches your lips, you're transported to a world where sweetness reigns supreme. Forget what you thought you knew about honey-processed coffees – Marco Tulio Sabillon's creation is here to set a new standard. It's like the coffee equivalent of finding the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, except in this case, the pot is filled with liquid honey, and the rainbow? Well, that's the spectrum of flavors you're about to experience.

The mouthfeel? It's softer than a cloud's daydream. Delicate yet assertive, it caresses your palate with the gentleness of a summer breeze, leaving you wondering if you're drinking coffee or sipping on the essence of comfort itself.

## A Symphony of Sweetness

Let's talk sweetness, because oh boy, does this coffee deliver! Atomic Coffee wasn't exaggerating when they said this micro-lot boasts an intensity of sweetness unlike any they've featured recently. It's not just sweet; it's a multi-layered symphony of saccharine delight.

Imagine biting into a ruby red grapefruit, its citrusy tang perfectly balanced by a honeyed sweetness that lingers long after the sip is gone. Now, add to that the rich, caramel-like notes of a dried fig, and you're starting to get the picture. But wait, there's more! A subtle chocolate undertone reminiscent of a Tootsie Roll adds depth and complexity, turning each sip into a flavor adventure.

## A Honey Process to Remember

The magic behind this flavor profile? It's all in the honey process. Picture coffee cherries basking in the Honduran sun, their natural sugars concentrating and infusing the beans with an intensity that's hard to match. It's like sending your coffee beans to a flavor spa, where they soak up all the goodness the fruit has to offer.

The result is a cup that strikes the perfect balance between clean taste and complex notes. It's the coffee equivalent of a world-class symphony orchestra – each flavor note plays its part perfectly, creating a harmonious experience that's greater than the sum of its parts.

## The Cooling Journey

Hold onto your mugs, folks, because as this coffee cools, it takes you on a flavor voyage that's nothing short of extraordinary. The initial honey sweetness evolves, making way for more nuanced flavors. That hint of ruby red grapefruit becomes more pronounced, adding a vibrant, zesty note that dances on your tongue.

As you continue sipping, the dried fig notes deepen, bringing a rich, almost wine-like complexity to the cup. And just when you think you've experienced it all, that Tootsie Roll essence sneaks in, adding a playful, nostalgic touch to the finish.

## The Story Behind the Beans

Every exceptional coffee has a tale to tell, and Marco Tulio Sabillon's story is as rich as his coffee's flavor profile. Nestled in the verdant mountains of Santa Barbara, Honduras, this coffee comes from a region known for producing some of the country's finest beans.

Marco and his brother embarked on their coffee-growing journey in 2006, but it was their bold decision to transition to specialty coffee that set them apart. Their commitment to quality paid off in 2018 when they brought their first lot of specialty-grade coffee to market. Talk about a glow-up story!

But what really makes this coffee stand out is the Parainema varietal – a local Honduran variety that's as unique as it is delicious. Known for its large, beautiful beans (we're talking Pacamara-level impressive here), Parainema brings a distinct character to the cup that's hard to find elsewhere.

## Atomic's Approach: From Cyclists to Coffee Connoisseurs

The story of Atomic Coffee is as intriguing as the coffees they roast. Founded in 1996 by two professional cyclist brothers, Atomic has pedaled its way from a simple café to a renowned micro-roastery. Their journey from asking, "How hard can it really be to run a cafe?" to becoming coffee roasting experts is a testament to their passion and dedication.

Atomic's commitment to quality is evident in every step of their process. From sourcing exceptional beans like Marco Tulio Sabillon's to roasting them to perfection on their Diedrich CR-35 & CR-70 roasters, they've mastered the art of bringing out the best in every bean.
