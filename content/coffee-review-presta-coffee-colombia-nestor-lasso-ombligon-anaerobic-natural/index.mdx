Not because anything dramatic happened externally, but because your palate just got absolutely blindsided by something exceptional.

## First Sip: Clean, Vibrant, and Immediately Captivating

The very first thing that hits you is how remarkably **clean** this coffee is. In the world of anaerobic naturals, "clean" isn't always a given — sometimes the processing can muddy things up or push funky fermentation notes too far into the foreground. Not here. This cup is crystal clear in its intention from the very first sip. It's vibrant, it's focused, and it immediately lets you know that something special is unfolding on your palate.

And right there in the opening act? **Raspberry jam.** Not the artificial, candy-aisle kind — we're talking the real deal. The kind your neighbor makes from fresh-picked berries and brings over in a mason jar with a handwritten label. It's sweet, it's bright, and it's so vivid it practically paints your tongue in shades of crimson.

## The Cooling Act: Where the Magic Deepens

Here's where things get really exciting. As this coffee cools down and opens up, a sparkling acidity emerges that is absolutely electric. It's the kind of brightness that doesn't assault your palate but rather dances across it — effervescent, lively, and persistent. It lingers on the palate in the most pleasant way, like the aftertaste of biting into a perfectly ripe raspberry on a warm afternoon.

The anaerobic process is doing something extraordinary here. Instead of overwhelming the cup with fermentation funk (which can be a pitfall with lesser-executed anaerobics), it's amplifying the natural vibrancy and warmth of the coffee. The acidity is bright but has a warm backbone to it — think sunshine through stained glass rather than a bare fluorescent bulb. It sparkles, but it also embraces.

## The Cocoa Nib Revelation

And then we arrive at what might be my favorite part of this entire cup — the cocoa nibs. But I need to be specific here, because not all cocoa nib notes are created equal. This isn't the dusty, stale cocoa powder note you sometimes get in darker roasted coffees. This is **freshly cracked, just-roasted cocoa seeds.** There's a brightness and freshness to it that elevates the entire profile. It's alive. It adds depth without heaviness, richness without muddiness, and a subtle bittersweet complexity that plays beautifully against the raspberry sweetness.

The interplay between the raspberry jam and the fresh cocoa nibs is nothing short of masterful — it's like a perfectly composed dessert where the pastry chef knew exactly when to stop adding ingredients. Everything here has a purpose, and nothing overstays its welcome.

## The Linger: A Persistent Pleasant Farewell

One of the hallmarks of a truly exceptional coffee is what happens after you swallow. And this Ombligón delivers one of the most pleasant, persistent finishes I've experienced in recent memory. The sparkling acidity doesn't just vanish — it slowly fades like the last notes of a symphony, leaving behind traces of warm berry sweetness and a gentle cocoa warmth that makes you immediately want another sip.

This is the kind of linger that turns a morning coffee into a meditation. You find yourself sitting there, cup in hand, just... savoring. Not reaching for another sip out of habit, but genuinely appreciating the ghost of flavor that's still performing on your palate.

## The Prodigy Behind the Beans

Nestor Lasso is only 25 years old, and he's already one of the most talked-about producers in specialty coffee. Let that sink in for a moment. At an age when most of us were still figuring out our careers, Nestor — alongside his brother Adrian — took full responsibility for their family's 14-hectare farm and completely reimagined what it could produce.

This is a third-generation coffee family, but Nestor and Adrian represent something entirely new. They shifted the entire operation away from commodity volume and toward micro-lot excellence. They didn't just tweak the family playbook — they rewrote it. And the results speak for themselves: their coffees have been featured in the **World Barista Championship** and **Brewers Cup** competitions, with the Ombligón variety itself contributing to a **3rd place finish at the 2024 World Barista Championship in Chicago.**

Read that again. Third place. At Worlds. With this exact variety.

Beyond their family farm, Nestor and Adrian partnered with fellow producer Jhoan Vergara to establish Finca El Diviso in Pitalito — the very farm where this coffee was grown. It's a collaborative project dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what Colombian coffee can be, with ideal growing conditions and a relentless commitment to innovation.

Nestor has also been nominated as "Most Notable Producer" in the prestigious Sprudgie Awards. For a 25-year-old coffee farmer, that's not just impressive — it's historic. He's proving that dedication to quality can transform not only a family's livelihood but an entire community's perception of coffee farming as a viable, respected profession.

## The Science of the Cup: Anaerobic Natural Processing

The processing behind this coffee is as meticulous as you'd expect from a producer of Nestor's caliber. This lot underwent a carefully controlled Anaerobic Natural process that reads more like a chemistry experiment than traditional coffee processing:

Cherries were hand-selected at optimal ripeness, measured between 21–24° Brix (that's seriously sweet fruit). They were placed in open plastic tanks for a 48-hour oxidation phase, during which the naturally released coffee must was constantly recirculated and monitored to maintain ideal fermentation conditions — roughly 19° Brix and a pH above 5.

After oxidation, the cherries were submerged in cold water to separate any underripe or underdeveloped fruit (only the densest, fully ripe cherries make the cut). Then comes a fascinating step: a 50°C warm water rinse that creates a controlled thermal shock, loosening the molecular structure of the fruit and kickstarting a more active fermentation phase.

Finally, the cherries were sealed in airtight plastic tanks for anaerobic fermentation — a completely oxygen-free environment where complex microbial activity develops the unique flavor characteristics that make this coffee sing. The cherries are then dried in their full fruit form, locking in all that developed complexity.

It's this level of precision and care that separates world-class lots from merely good ones. Every step has been thought through, tested, and refined.

## The Region: Huila's Rising Star

Huila has quietly become one of the most exciting coffee-producing regions on the planet. Centered around Pitalito, where Finca El Diviso is located, the region sits where the Central and Eastern ranges of the Andes converge — creating a unique microclimate that's ideal for growing exceptional coffee.

What makes Huila's recent rise so compelling is that it's been driven by the producers themselves. Predominantly smallholder farms, the region has made a concerted effort over the past decade to shift toward specialty coffee production. Selective manual harvesting, attentive processing, and meticulous post-harvest sorting have all contributed to Huila's growing recognition on the global stage.

The region also holds deep historical significance, with pre-Columbian archaeological sites at San Augustín featuring stone carvings and artifacts that offer a window into the land's rich cultural past. It's fitting that a region with such deep roots is now producing some of the most forward-thinking coffee in the world.

## Roaster's Spotlight: Presta Coffee

Presta Coffee continues to be one of the most exciting roasters in the specialty coffee scene. Operating out of Tucson since 2014 and roasting in small batches on a 15kg Joper Roaster, they handle coffee with the kind of care and respect that producers like Nestor Lasso deserve.

What sets Presta apart is their willingness to embrace the experimental. They source traditionally processed coffees alongside wild, innovative lots — always with the goal of encouraging the evolution of coffee and showcasing what's possible when talented producers push boundaries. This Ombligón is a perfect example of that philosophy in action.

## The Final Verdict

Presta's Colombia Nestor Lasso Ombligón Anaerobic Natural is, quite simply, one of the best coffees I've tasted this year. It's clean when so many anaerobics are messy. It's vibrant when lesser coffees would be flat. It's complex without being confusing, and sweet without being cloying. The raspberry jam and fresh cocoa nib interplay is something I'll be thinking about for weeks.

At $25 for 8oz, this is absolutely a premium offering — but when you consider that you're drinking the same variety that helped earn a 3rd place finish at the World Barista Championship, produced by one of Colombia's most promising young talents, the value proposition becomes crystal clear. This is world-class coffee, and it's priced accordingly.

If you're looking for a coffee that reminds you why you fell in love with specialty coffee in the first place, grab a bag before it's gone. Coffees like this don't stick around, and producers like Nestor Lasso are the future of the industry.

Here's to the next generation of coffee excellence — and to every sip that makes us stop, savor, and smile.
