## The Flavors: An Odyssey for the Palate 🍎🥧

Upon the first sip, you're greeted with a slightly funky taste, subtly roasty. As it cools, the juiciness becomes evident. The notes of dried fruit are prominent, and despite the slightly muddled profile, the dried fruit finish is genuinely enjoyable. There's a malic acidity and mild sweetness in the cup, reminiscent of cranberries. The lingering stone fruit finish is the cherry on top. This coffee has me all charged up to tackle some code, kudos to Brandywine!

Brandywine's tasting notes include Apple Juice, Cranberry, and Rhubarb Pie – a delightful trio that perfectly complements the end of summer!

## Behind the Brew ☀️

The Las Lajas favorite is making a comeback, sweeter than ever! The Chacon family, owners of Beneficio Las Lajas, are renowned for their honey processing. Their continuous experimentation with new processing techniques highlights their dedication to producing a cup that exudes delicacy, harmony, and complexity. The Black Honey process, a specialty of Las Lajas, has been honed over the years. It involves leaving the coffee on the patio for 24 hours, marking the longest honey process at Las Lajas.
