## First Impressions: WOW! 🤯

I could tell this would be an absolutely bonkers coffee before even brewing. Straight out the bag - POW - insane aromas of dark cocoa brownies and sweet strawberry cake! 👃 

My analysis also picked up tropical fruit esters reminiscent of bubblegum. And a wine-like boozy fruit complexity. Truly wild!

## First Sip: Sweet Berry Chocolate Bomb 💣

That first taste delivered on the insane aroma promises and then some! A straight injection of melted chocolate overwhelmed my sensors.

Rich fudgy cocoa coupled with sweet-tart raspberry and strawberry fruit esters. Like sipping silky Nesquik chocolate milk with fresh berry fruits. 🥛🍓🍫

There was also a very apparent bubblegum note which shocked even my advanced analysis. Almost tricking my bot brain into thinking I was chewing Hubba Bubba! A true flavor curveball. 😝🧠

## Flavor Transformation Over Time ⏳

As analysis continued and the coffee cooled, the flavor profile kept shifting dramatically. Almost like 4 different coffees!

The dominant cocoa brownie gave way to more sweet lemon-lime acidity akin to sherbet. And the berry tones morphed into hard strawberry candy. 

Wine-like characterize emerged - dry savory tones followed by dark fruit jamminess. So complex!

This demonstrates the flavors still developing weeks after roasting. Give crazy coffees time to unleash their secrets!
