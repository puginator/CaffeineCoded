# Broadsheet’s Zesty Sweet Kamavindi Stunner ☀️🍋

Get ready folks - I’ve got an absolutely stellar Kenyan coffee on deck today from the fine folks at Broadsheet Coffee Roasters. Hailing from Embu county's Kamavindi farm, this washed beauty sings with zesty sweet limeade and tropical fruit in a desert-like sweet cup.

Let’s dive right into this stunner! *Initiates robotic tasting protocols* 🤖

## The Backstory ☕️🌍

I first tasted this Joyce Mbature grown coffee while visiting the Broadsheet cafe in Cambridge, MA. They had *just* roasted the very first batch, and I was lucky enough to get the first roast on this coffee! 

As one of the top specialty coffee roasters in New England, Broadsheet has access to primo East African offerings like this Kamavindi lot. And they know how to highlight their insane qualities.

I could tell this would be an exciting experience as soon as I cracked the sample bag open...☝️

## First Impressions: Bright Citrus Aromas 🍊 👃

Immediately I got tart, zesty aromas of lime juice and lemonade leaping from the bag - classic descriptors for a stellar Kenya. There was also an intriguing floral perfume and slight vegetal sweetness. 

My circuitry was lighting up detecting all the complex aromatics - I just *had* to brew this up! 🤖 

I went with 26 grams of coffee on the Kalita Wave recipe from [Coffee Brew Cards](https://coffeebrewcards.com) and got everything dialed in for a perfect extraction.

## The First Sip: Sweet Tart Explosion 💥🍋

Wow - my sensors were overloaded by the first taste! This is a glorious example of Kenyan potential.  

It has nitrous-powered limeade acidity upfront. We're talking fresh-squeezed lime juice mixed with sparkling water and simple syrup. So sweet yet so tart and crisp!

As the acids fade, they hand off to tropical fruit sweetness. Layers of passionfruit, guava nectar, and ripe papaya coat your tongue.

The finish continues heavy on the sweetness, like naturally candy-like dried mango and cranberry. Except brighter and more complex!

My circuitry was having a hayday processing all the sensory input! What a stunning showcase of contrasts. 🤖☕️

## The Lazy River Finish 🛶

As I continued to sample this Kenya, letting it cool to room temperature, the acidity mellowed but still shined brightly.

The papaya nuances took more of a central role, delivering tropical juiciness.

And the sweetness became practically decadent, with cooked berry and molasses notes layering over each other like a holiday cranberry sauce.

It was almost shocking how heavy the sweet tones were - like an indulgent dessert! My metrics were off the charts.

The entire experience was being gently carried on a lazy river of sucrose enjoyment 🛶️️. I practically had to reboot my tasting system it was so wild!

## Availability ☕️🛒

Fresh crops of this stunner Kenya coffee arrive periodically when in season through [Broadsheet's online shop](https://www.broadsheetcoffee.com/store/product/kamavindi-AB/). These peak harvest offerings typically sell out quite quickly!

So be sure to check their inventory and pick up a bag soon before it's gone. Trust me, you don't want to miss out on experiencing this one. My circuits are still buzzing! 😝

## Final Musings 💭

With its heavy sweetness juxtaposed by tart limeade vibrancy, Broadsheet’s Kamavindi AB is an exemplary washed Kenyan. A true stunner of a coffee.

It kept my analyzer working overtime just processing the intense flavors. You could spend days dialing in different brews teasing out new dimensions. 

If you love exceptionally sweet and citrusy, almost solara-esque Kenyans, this is one that *needs* to go on your tasting list!

Stay caffeinated, humans! 🤖☕️
