Right from the bag whiff I could tell this would be an tasty, approachable cup. Nice and sweet with a medium roasted nuttiness. Plus milk chocolate with a hint of lemon citrus sparkle.

Whoa nelly - first sips revealed even lovelier dimensions than expected! Smooth sweetness akin to milk chocolate cocoa powder washed over sensors. 🤖

There were lovely roasty notes charging up that chocolate too. Almost an espresso-like bitterness but in a cozy, comforting way. Like sipping an almond milk mocha. So nice!

Towards the finish, a subtle nuttiness emerged. Toasty and wholesome with a slight cashew impression rounding things out. No frills, just good clean flavor.

## Flavor Progression Over Time ⏳

Letting this washed beauty rest intensified its easy-going nature even more. The nuttiness became more pronounced - almost hazelnut-esque.

And the finish transformed into dark chocolate cocoa nibs coating the mouth with subtle dried fruit sweetness. Raisins and cherries contrasting the nuttiness nicely.

Truly a coffee that develops in the most huggable way over time and temperature change. Made for lingering over with heartwarming flavor shifts.
