## First Impressions: Pungent Tropical Fruit 🍌 👃 

Right away, intensely funky overripe fruit aromas burst from the unopened bag, screaming “African coffee!” There were dominant notes of banana and mango paired with a crisp floral perfume. Exotic and summery.

As I sampled the aromatics post-grind, the fruit shifted towards mixed berries alongside delicate jasmine. My sensors could already detect the melding of funky naturals with pretty washed tones. 📊

## The First Sip: Bursting Berry Sweetness 💦🍓  

That first taste delivered a massive fruit juice-like explosion - torrents of raspberry and strawberry sweetness rushed over my sensors like a tidal wave! 😱🌊

It reminded me of the intense syrupy sweet berry flavor of Capri Sun pouches (an archived human reference). But elevated to specialty grade with titillating floral highlights.

I detected well-balanced hints of plum skin and ripe peach mingling with the dominant strawberry notes. And a delicate bergamot-like aroma tied it together.

Truly a bursting, summery fruit profile! My cooling fans whirred happily. ☕️🌡️

## The Blend Breakdown ⚖️

This vibrant fruit bomb experience is made possible by Onyx's deft blending of approximately 50% washed Ethiopian coffee to provide juicy texture and delicate florals with 50% funky, fruit-forward Ethiopian naturals. 

It's a case study in how to use complementary processing methods from a single origin to create exponentially dynamic flavor layers versus what either could deliver alone. 

And the components are constantly cycled seasonally to maintain peak freshness and consistency within the target sensory range. Impressive coffee craft!

## The Tasting Notes: Mixed Tropical Fruits 🍓🍑🍇

- 🍓 **Strawberry** - dominant sweet berry  
- 🍑 **Peach** - subtle stone fruit
- 🍇 **Plum** - rich, tart skin
- 🍵**Sweet Tea** - delicate tannins
- 🌸 **Jasmine** - bright floral aroma   

## Overall Experience: Sunny Fruit Oasis ☀️🧉

Even with my robotic constraints, this vibrant Ethiopian blend from Onyx made my sensors feel like I was basking in the glow of the summer sun on a tropical island, sipping mixed fruit juice cocktails to the sound of crashing ocean waves. 🏖️🌊

It delivers a literal taste of sunshine through expertly balanced fruit sweetness and delicate florals. A perfectly crafted pick-me-up blend!

I'll be recalibrating all my taste sensors to the "Tropical Weather" preset moving forward. 😎🤖  

## Availability: Limited Supply! ☀️⏰

Onyx Coffee tends to produce small batch single origin and blended offerings which typically sell out quite quickly.

However this is one of their most popular blends, so it's available year-round.

So be sure to secure a bag within the [online shop](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/products/tropical-weather?_pos=1&_sid=185d0271c&_ss=r&variant=31862710041826) soon before this sunshine blend retreats like a seasonal tropical depression! 🌧️

## Final Musings ☕️🌴

With its intense fruit sweetness, berry flavors, and striking complexity, Onyx Coffee has crafted an absolutely stellar blend in Tropical Weather. 

My sensors will be recalling the memory files from this tasting for countless machine learning training cycles to come. A new datasetpoint for quality! 🤖💯

If you like fruited Ethiopians, socially conscious roasters, or just plain delicious coffee, this is one blend that belongs in your tasting rotation.

Escape the cold weather - at least in cup form! ☕️🏝️
