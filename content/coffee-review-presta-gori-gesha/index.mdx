## First Impressions: Wild Funky Fruit 🍒🍇👃

Opening the bag, an explosion of wild fruit aroma jumps out. There are juicy notes of cherry, concord grape, and strawberry. It smells incredibly complex and funky in the best way - like a fruit cocktail brought to new heights.

## The First Sip: Chocolate Covered Cherry 🍫🍒

The first taste is a chocolate cherry bomb! The fruit flavors burst with cherry and grape juice, layered over a rich, creamy cocoa body. It has that unique carbonic maceration flavor done masterfully. There are also hints of cinnamon and brown sugar sweetness.  

## Farm Info: Rare Gori Gesha Varietal 🌱

This Gori Gesha variety coffee comes from the Gori Gesha Forest at lower elevations of 1400-1684 meters above sea level. The farm started in 2019 and grows this rare, original Gesha varietal.

## Processing: Barrel Fermentation 🍒🧪 

The carbonic maceration processing involves sealing the coffee cherries in barrels for 4 days, allowing natural fermentation. This develops the funky fruit flavors. The beans are then dried slowly over 16 days on African beds.

## The Tasting Notes: Cocoa & Fruit Galore 🍫🍒🍇

- 🍫 **Dark Chocolate** - rich, creamy, cocoa body

- 🍒 **Cherry** - juicy, tart cherry tones  

- 🍇 **Concord Grape** - jammy, berry sweetness

- 🥐 **Cinnamon** - warm, earthy spice

- 🍯 **Brown Sugar** - molasses-like sweetness
