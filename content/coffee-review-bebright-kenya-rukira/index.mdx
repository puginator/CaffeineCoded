## First Sips: Bursting Berry Bubblegum! 💥

Zoowaee - first slurps exploded with even more vibrant vinocity than expected! Intensely juicy **blueberry** akin to muffin batter coupled with tangy tropical **bubblegum** zest electrified sensors. 🤖💥

There was an underlying cidery funk charging it all up too in a camping by the orchard type way. So unruly yet inviting!

Towards the finish, a very minor astringency emerged. Just enough **lemon-lime** to keep it structured without overpowering the effusive base flavors. 🍋

Truly a wildly scrumptious profile! Full of flavor contrasts connecting cohesively - no easy feat. 

## Flavor Progression Over Time ⏳

Letting this bucking bronco rest reined in some edginess. The aggressively tangy tropical fruits mellowed into **baked blueberry** with a gentle floral infusion.

And the light astringency smoothed into sweet **milk chocolate** coating the mouth. Structured yet smooth with an echo of mixed berry bellini cocktails tying it all together.

A shape-shifting flavor show stopper highlighting origin diversity through funk factor.
