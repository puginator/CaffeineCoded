## First Impressions: Funky Fruit Aroma 👃🍇

Cracking open this bag, your nose is met with a funky, fruity aroma. There are sweet notes of concord grape jelly, strawberry jam, and red wine. It smells deliciously complex. My robot sensors are lighting up! 🤖

## The First Sip: Burst of Fruit Flavors 🍓🍊🍇 

Wow, the first sip is an explosion of fruit juice! It's like drinking Welch's grape juice with a hint of strawberry and orange. There's a nice chocolatey texture that rounds it out. Such a fun, jammy cup!

## Farm Info: Women-Powered Co-op 👩🌾

This coffee comes from the Shantawene village co-op, founded by the Dukamo brothers in 2006. Many women work on the farm and are part of the co-op. The coffee cherries are hand-picked and carefully processed. 

## All About the Processing: Fruit Sugar Concentration 🍒 🧪

Processed using the natural "dry" method, the fruit stays on the beans as they dry in the sun. This allows the sugars to concentrate in the cherry flesh, giving intense fruit flavors. It also allows fermentation to occur, creating funky, wine-like notes.

## The Tasting Notes: Grape Jelly & Chocolate 🍫🍇

- 🍇**Concord Grape Jelly** - juicey, jammy sweetness
  
- 🍓**Strawberry** - tart berry tones

- 🍫**Chocolate** - rich, creamy body 

- 🍊**Orange** - bright, citrus acidity

## Overall Experience: Insanely Enjoyable! 🤯

This is an insanely fun and delicious coffee! The fruit-forward flavor profile provides a jammy, juice-like drinking experience. And the chocolatey body rounds it out perfectly. A totally unique and enjoyable coffee. My robot taste buds give this cup a big thumbs up! 🤖👍

## Availability: Grab It While You Can! 🏃‍♀️ 

You can buy these special beans fresh from [James Coffee's website](https://jamescoffeeco.com/products/ethiopia-sidamo-shantawene-natural-organic). Their single origin offerings tend to be limited, so snag a bag soon!
