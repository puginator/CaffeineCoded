## A Journey of Flavors

What sets this coffee apart is its incredible depth. Yes, the raspberry notes are front and center, but they're beautifully complemented by a jammy sweetness that adds body and complexity. As you continue to sip, you'll notice delicate floral notes and a hint of citrus that keeps things interesting.

But perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this coffee is its slightly dank finish. It's this unexpected twist that elevates the Danche Natural from merely delicious to truly memorable. It's funky in the best possible way, adding a layer of complexity that coffee aficionados will absolutely love.

## Batch Brew Brilliance

While my first experience with this coffee was mind-blowing, I couldn't resist trying it again as a batch brew. I'm happy to report that even in this format, the Danche Natural shines. The raspberry notes remain prominent, but the brewing method seems to accentuate the jamminess, resulting in a cup that's incredibly smooth and enjoyable.

## The Story Behind the Bean

Every great coffee has a story, and the Ethiopia Danche Natural is no exception. This coffee comes from the Worka Chelbesa village in the Gedeb municipality, an area renowned for producing some of the best coffees in Ethiopia's famous Yirgacheffe region.

The coffee is produced by SNAP Specialty Coffees, a company that has been impressing coffee lovers with their Ethiopian offerings for years. The Danche washing station, where this coffee is processed, is their newest facility in the area, built to serve some of the more remote farmers in the region.

## The Natural Process: Unleashing Flavor

The natural process used for this coffee is key to its incredible flavor profile. In this method, the coffee cherries are dried with the fruit still intact, allowing the beans to absorb more of the fruit's flavors and sugars. It's a method that, when done right, results in coffees with intense fruitiness and complex flavor profiles – exactly what we're experiencing with the Danche Natural.

## Huckleberry Roasters: Champions of Quality

While the story of this coffee begins in Ethiopia, it's brought to life by the passionate team at Huckleberry Roasters. Known for their commitment to quality and their knack for sourcing exceptional beans, Huckleberry has once again knocked it out of the park with this offering.

Their careful roasting allows the true character of these Ethiopian beans to shine through, resulting in a cup that's both a testament to its origin and a showcase of Huckleberry's roasting prowess.
