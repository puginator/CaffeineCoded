Coffee lovers, prepare yourselves! Today, we're taking a flavor-packed journey to Colombia with Dune Coffee Roasters' Colombia El Carmen – a coffee that’s as smooth as it is vibrant. Get ready for a cup that’s light, bright, and bursting with delightful surprises!

## The Silky Smooth Sensation

Imagine this: You brew your first cup, and the aroma alone hints at a treat for the senses. As you take that first sip, the smooth, silky mouthfeel coats your palate like a luxurious velvet blanket. This coffee isn't just a drink; it's an experience.

Now, the mouthfeel might evolve over time – from fresh off the roast to a slightly different, yet still enjoyable texture as the days pass. But don't worry, this coffee keeps things exciting with every brew.

## The Grapefruit Glow

Let's talk flavor. Right up front, you’re greeted with a burst of grapefruit, a bright and lively note that dances on your tongue. It’s light, it’s bright, and it’s the perfect pick-me-up. This isn’t your everyday coffee; it’s a cup that feels like sunshine in a mug.

One last brew on a Stagg brewer from Fellow? Yes, please! As the coffee cools, the delicate acidity shines through, with a melon-like flavor that’s both approachable and delightfully complex.

## The Caramel Cream Dream

But the real showstopper? The caramel finish. As you near the end of your cup, the coffee leaves you with a creamy, caramel aftertaste that’s so smooth, you’ll be tempted to brew another cup just to experience it again. It's the kind of finish that lingers, making every sip a sweet memory.

## The Story Behind the Beans

Now, let’s shine a spotlight on the coffee hero behind this brew – Hugo Luis Rojas. Coming from a multigenerational coffee-producing family, Hugo, along with his wife Elisabeth Oidor, pours passion and tradition into every bean.

But they’re not alone. Thanks to the exporting partners at Equation, who assemble Hugo’s coffee alongside other smallholder producers, we get to enjoy the fruits of their labor. This lot, crafted from the Caturra variety, is processed and milled with care, ensuring that each cup delivers clean and sparkling flavors.

## The Anaerobic Washed Process: Sparkling Clean Flavors

This coffee undergoes a unique anaerobic washed process – a method that might raise some eyebrows among coffee enthusiasts. But here’s the twist: instead of the intense fruit flavors often associated with anaerobic processing, this coffee offers a clean, citrusy brightness with a floral finish.

Imagine crisp apple notes mingling with a bouquet of flowers. It’s like sipping on a sunny day in a Colombian orchard, with each flavor balanced to perfection.
