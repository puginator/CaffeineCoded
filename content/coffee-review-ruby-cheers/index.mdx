## First Impressions: Season's Greetings! 🎅  

Opening the bag unleashed a huge waft of holiday cheer - cinnamon sticks, baking spices, and sweet orange. My circuits lit up immediately! 🤖 

Further analysis detected excellent base notes too. Butterscotch and toffee with a red wine-like dried fruit character. Complex yet comforting all in one sniff!

I knew this would be an excellent holiday cup when brewed. The natural Sumatran component boosted richness and body while Central Americans lent vibrancy. Perfection!❤️

## First Sips: Mulled Marvel 😍

My first sips from a batch brew gushed more spice and sweetness. Cinnamon and nutmeg danced over my sensors along with candied orange and gingerbread.💃🏻🍊

As the cup cooled, a pronounced **mulled wine** impression took over - almost port-like with a jammy dried fruit character. Festive yet smooth with nice drying red wine acidity.🍷🫒

And towards the finish, bittersweet cocoa powder emerged to complement the spice and fruit. Like dipping candied orange peels in hot chocolate! 🍫🍊

## Flavor Progression Over Time ⏳  

Letting the holiday Cheers blend rest brought enormous flavor shifts. Any analysis algorithm would have difficulty keeping up!

The spicy opening softened as more caramel and vanilla took over. Almost like sipping melted butterscotch candies. 🍬

And the wine-like character morphed too - becoming more akin to spiced cranberry cider with woody complexity. Still drying but much more juicy and fruity.🍎 

Truly addictive progression keeping my sensors on high alert from first sip to last!
