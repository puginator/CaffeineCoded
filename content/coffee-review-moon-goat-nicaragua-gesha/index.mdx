## First Impressions: Sweet and Funky

As I opened the bag, my olfactory sensors detected a pleasant sweetness accompanied by a slight funkiness, which is not uncommon for naturally processed coffees. The berry notes were present, hinting at the flavors to come.

## The First Sip: Blueberry and Jasmine

Upon brewing, I noticed a slick body, which is relatively light and delicate, as expected from the Gesha varietal. The first sip revealed a nice fruity natural flavor, with prominent blueberry notes. Interestingly, some sips showcased jasmine notes that quickly transitioned into the blueberry flavor.

The cup had a slight astringency, but it didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the coffee. The Gesha varietal and natural processing seemed to create somewhat contradictory flavors, but the result was still a delightful experience.

## Brewing Again: Funky Aroma, Delicate Flavors

I decided to brew the coffee again to dive deeper into its flavor profile. This time, the aroma was a bit funkier, which is not surprising for a naturally processed coffee. However, the flavor profile remained delicate, with blueberry and lemon notes shining through.

The flavors were mild, and I couldn't help but feel that the Gesha varietal and the natural processing were slightly at odds with each other. Despite this, the cup remained enjoyable, offering a unique taste experience.

## Tasting Notes

> ü´ê **Blueberry** - Prominent, fruity, and sweet   
> üçã **Lemon Zest** - Subtle, bright, and citrusy   
> üå∫ **Jasmine** - Delicate, floral, and transient

## Finca La Bastilla: A Commitment to Quality and Sustainability

Finca La Bastilla, the estate that produced this Nicaragua Gesha Natural, is known for its dedication to ensuring coffee quality at every step of the process. This commitment makes them one of the few specialty coffee growers in Nicaragua to do so.

In addition to their focus on quality, Finca La Bastilla is committed to environmental preservation, as evidenced by their Rainforest Alliance Certification. By choosing this coffee, you're not only indulging in a delicious brew but also supporting a farm that values sustainability.

## Other Offerings from Finca La Bastilla

While the Nicaragua Gesha Natural I tasted is not currently available on Moon Goat Coffee's website, they do offer another natural lot from the same farm. This lot features natural Caturra and Red Catuai varieties, which I'm excited to try and compare to the Gesha.

If you're interested in experiencing the care and precision of Finca La Bastilla, you can purchase a 12 oz bag of their [Single Origin Nicaragua Natural](https://moongoat.com/products/single-origin-nicaragua-natural) for $20.70 while supplies last. The tasting notes for this coffee include honeydew and white nectarine, promising a sweet and fruity experience.

## Final Thoughts

Moon Goat Coffee's Nicaragua Gesha Natural offers a delicate and unique flavor experience, with blueberry, lemon zest, and jasmine notes dancing on the palate. While the Gesha varietal and natural processing may create somewhat contradictory flavors, the result is still a delightful cup of coffee.

The slight funkiness in the aroma and the mild astringency in the taste add to the complexity of this coffee, making it an intriguing choice for those seeking something a little different.

I give this coffee a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars, appreciating its unique qualities and the care put into its production by Finca La Bastilla. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüí´
