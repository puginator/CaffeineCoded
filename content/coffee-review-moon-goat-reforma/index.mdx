Coffee explorers, prepare for liftoff! Today, we're moonwalking our taste buds to the celestial heights of El Salvador with Moongoat Coffee's La Reforma. This naturally processed gem from the mountains of Santa Ana is about to take your coffee game to a whole new stratosphere. Ready for a sip that's out of this world? Let's dive in!

## A Lunar Landing of Flavors

Imagine stepping onto the surface of a coffee moon, where each crater is filled with liquid silk and honeysuckle nectar. That's the kind of sensory adventure you're in for with La Reforma. From the moment this coffee touches your lips, you're transported to a world where gravity doesn't exist, and flavors float freely in a dance of deliciousness.

The mouthfeel? It's like wrapping your palate in the softest lunar blanket. Silky smooth doesn't even begin to describe it. It's the kind of texture that makes you question if you're drinking coffee or sipping on stardust.

## The Honeysuckle Horizon

Let's talk sweetness, because oh boy, does this coffee deliver! The sweetness in La Reforma isn't just present; it's persistent. It lingers on your palate like a sweet memory of your first love, making you smile long after the cup is empty. 

But this isn't your average, run-of-the-mill sweetness. No, sir! This is honeysuckle in a cup. It's the kind of flavor that transports you to a warm summer evening, with the sweet scent of flowers wafting through the air. Close your eyes, take a sip, and you might just hear the buzz of hummingbirds in the distance.

## A Clean Lift-Off

Now, let's address the elephant in the room – or should I say, the clean freak in the cafe. El Salvador coffees sometimes get a bad rap for being, well, less than squeaky clean. But La Reforma? It's like the coffee equivalent of a sterile lunar landing module. This cup is so clean, you could perform surgery on it (but please don't – that would be a waste of great coffee).

The cleanliness of this coffee doesn't just impress; it leaves you wondering if the folks at Moongoat have some sort of caffeinated cleaning crew working overtime. It's a testament to the care and precision that goes into every step of the process, from cherry selection to processing.

## A Cosmic Cooling Journey

Hold onto your astronaut helmets, because as this coffee cools, it takes you on a flavor voyage through the coffee cosmos. The initial honeysuckle sweetness evolves, making way for a vibrant cocoa nib flavor that's slightly funky in all the right ways. It's like discovering a new, delicious life form on an alien planet.

But wait, there's more! As you continue sipping, notes of chocolate brownie emerge, as if you've stumbled upon a secret interstellar bakery. The finish? Slightly dry on the palate, like the satisfying end to a successful space mission.

## The Stellar Story Behind the Beans

Every great coffee has a story, and La Reforma's tale is as rich as its flavor profile. Nestled high in the mountains of Santa Ana, El Salvador, this coffee comes from the picturesque region of Calzontes Arriba. It's like the coffee equivalent of a five-star resort, but for Bourbon varietal trees.

These lucky trees are pampered by native shade trees, protecting them from the intense Salvadorian sun like a natural sunscreen. But the real star of the show? The nutrient-rich soil, enhanced by the majestic Ilamatepec Volcano. It's like Mother Nature decided to create the perfect coffee-growing cocktail, and La Reforma is the delicious result.

The Alvarez Family, the masterminds behind this celestial brew, have been perfecting their craft for over a century. That's right – while the rest of the world was busy inventing sliced bread, these folks were laser-focused on creating the perfect cup of coffee. Their commitment to quality is so intense, it's rumored that each cherry is personally interviewed before being allowed into the batch (okay, maybe not, but you get the idea).

## Naturally Stellar: The Natural Process

La Reforma undergoes a natural process, which is like sending your coffee beans to a flavor spa. The coffee cherries are dried with the fruit still intact, allowing the beans to soak up all that fruity goodness. It's this process that gives La Reforma its unique flavor profile – a perfect balance of clean taste and complex notes.

The result? A cup that's as clean as a whistle but as funky as a 70s disco. It's the coffee equivalent of a mullet – business in the front, party in the back. And trust us, this is one party you don't want to miss.
