It had been a while since I'd savored a Kenyan coffee, and oh, how I'd missed it! From the moment I ground these beans, the aroma promised something special. The anticipation built as I recalled the espresso I'd enjoyed in Syra's Barcelona store - slightly darker than my usual preference but undeniably enjoyable. Little did I know, this bag I'd brought home was about to redefine my Kenyan coffee experience.

## The First Sip: A Symphony of Sweet and Tart

As I brewed my first cup at home, the excitement was palpable. Would it live up to the memories of Barcelona? The answer was a resounding yes - and then some! This Kenya Muthuthuini is everything I hope for in a Kenyan coffee, and then it pushes the boundaries even further.

The first sip is a revelation - a perfect balance of sweetness and tartness that dances on the palate. We're talking about a cranberry acidity so vibrant it almost sparkles, harmoniously paired with a warming honey sweetness that envelops your taste buds. It's like the coffee equivalent of a perfectly orchestrated symphony, where each note plays its part in creating a masterpiece.

## The Pour Over Performance

Eager to explore the full range of this coffee's potential, I brewed it again using a pour-over method. If the first brew was a revelation, this was an epiphany. The Muthuthuini continued to sing, its bright acidity now complemented by a robust body that whispered of apple butter - all sweetness and depth.

This is a coffee that evolves in the cup, revealing new layers of complexity with each sip. It's a testament to the careful processing and roasting that allows the true character of these Kenyan beans to shine through.

## The Story in Every Sip

Every exceptional coffee tells a story, and the Kenya Muthuthuini's tale is one of community, tradition, and meticulous care. Produced by small-scale farmers at the Muthuthuini Factory in Gikondi, Mukurweini sub-county of Nyeri, this coffee is a proud representative of Kenya's rich coffee heritage.

Founded in the early 1960s, the Muthuthuini Factory is one of seven wet processing stations managed by the Ruthaka Farmers Co-operative Society. This co-op has built a reputation for high-quality, delicious coffee, and this lot certainly lives up to that promise.

## A Profile of Perfection

Grown at altitudes between 1700 and 1800 meters above sea level, the Muthuthuini offers a medium body paired with a medium-high acidity - a profile that's complex enough to intrigue coffee connoisseurs yet accessible enough to charm casual drinkers.

The washed process brings out the best in these beans, highlighting delightful notes of green tea, brown sugar, rose, raspberry, and strawberry. With a cupping score of 88, it's clear that this is a coffee of exceptional quality.

## The Art of Production

The care that goes into producing this coffee is evident in every sip. Approximately 1000 cooperative members cultivate Arabica varieties SL28, SL34, Batian, and Ruiru 11 in rich volcanic soils. The main harvest runs from October to December, with a secondary season from May to July.

Each cherry is hand-picked at peak ripeness, then undergoes a meticulous process:

1. Depulping
2. 16-hour fermentation
3. Washing with pure water from the Ruarai River
4. Sun-drying on raised beds for 14-21 days

This careful process, combined with an average annual production of 150 metric tons of cherries, places the Muthuthuini Factory alongside its sister factories (Nduma, Ruarai, Kibutio, Mukui, Kamucuni, and Karaba) as a significant contributor to Nyeri's esteemed coffee tradition.
