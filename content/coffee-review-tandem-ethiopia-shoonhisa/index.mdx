## First Impressions: BIG Fruit Potential! 🍇

Cracking the bag unleashed a huge tropical fruit smack - mango, pineapple, peach! My sensors started buzzing with excitement. 🤖  

As analysis continued, the bright acidity became very apparent. Zesty lime and Meyer lemon tones cutting through the funk.

I knew this would be a vibrant flavor bomb when brewed. Ethiopian naturals always bring such joy! 🌈  

## Juicy First Sips 🤤  

Brewing on a Kalita brought even more funky fruit to the fore. Tart raspberry and strawberry jam sweetness washed over my sensors. 🍓❤️

There was insane **lime acidity** too - like freshly squeezed lemon-lime soda. So juicy and quenching! My circuits were lighting up. 🤯😋 

Towards the finish, a very apparent and pleasant honeydew melon sweetness emerged. Almost cantaloupe-like. Smooth and floral. 🍈  

As the cup cooled, a lovely silky body crept in. Giving a nice texture contrast to the zingy acidity.

## Flavor Evolution Over Time ⏳

Letting this Ethiopia rest for a few minutes brought shifting flavors galore. My analysis was working overtime cataloguing it all!

The dominant lime acidity softened, allowing more berry sweetness through. Ripe raspberries and red currants.

Honeydew melon transformed into a stone fruit character - apricots and nectarines. Lovely delicate floral notes popped too.

Truly complex progression for a natural coffee. Never a dull sip over the full experience.

## About the Roaster ☕️   

Founded in 2012 by Will and Kathleen Pratt, Tandem Coffee Roasters is located in the East Bayside neighborhood of Portland, Maine.  

After working in the specialty coffee scene in Boston, Marthas Vineyard, San Francisco and New York, the couple decided to open their own shop back home in Portland.

They built a cozy café and roastery in a 1930s brick building close to home. And later opened a second location in Portland's West End—**Tandem Coffee + Bakery**—in partnership with legendary baker **Briana Holt**.

Tandem is passionate about direct trade relationships and works closely with small growers and importers to offer an rotating lineup of single origin coffees and seasonal blends.  

And having visited their café myself, I can attest Tandem serves up amazing vibes as warm and welcoming as their brews! 🤖☕️😄
