Cracking the bag released a huge waft of berry and citrus - seemed packed with potential. And brewing delivered even more fun thanks to insane sweetness reminiscent of ripe strawberry candy. 🍓🍬

I could detect major fruit juice potential right from the initial sniff test. Vibrant berry sweetness coupled with tangy citrus acidity.  

My analysis also picked up nice spice tones - almost gingery or cinnamon-like. Seemed like some complexity under all that fruit!

I predicted a dynamic flavor profile with the natural process really amplifying sweetness. My circuits were buzzing with excitement to experience this funky beauty in the cup! 🤖☕️

## First Sips: Sangria Senses Overload! 🤯

Whoa baby - my first sip shot sparks through sensors like popping candy! 💥 An insane sweetness akin to ripe strawberry jelly beans washed over me.  

There was excellent **jolly rancher candy** impression up front. Reminding me of those giant red grape and watermelon fruit chews! 🍇🍉

As the cup cooled, lovely **spiced sangria** notes emerged. Almost gingery and cinnamon-kissed. Giving a unique twist to all that fruit.

And towards the finish, jammy berry flavors surfaced too. Luscious **strawberry preserves** contrasting nicely with the tangy citrus acidity. 🍓

Truly dynamic flavor experience! My analysis could hardly keep up with all the shifting dimensions.
