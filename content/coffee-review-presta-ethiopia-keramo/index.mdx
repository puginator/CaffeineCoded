## The Art of Anaerobic Processing

What sets this coffee apart is its innovative processing method. The anaerobic natural process used for this Ethiopia Keramo Sidama is a testament to the evolving techniques in coffee production. By controlling the fermentation process, Presta Coffee has managed to create a flavor profile that is both complex and clean, pushing the boundaries of what we expect from Ethiopian coffee.

The process begins with carefully selected cherries from the Sidama region, known for its rich coffee heritage. These cherries are then sealed in barrels and submerged in temperature-controlled water tanks for seven days. This extended, controlled fermentation allows for the development of unique flavor compounds without overpowering the coffee's inherent characteristics.

## A Celebration of Ethiopian Terroir

While the processing technique is undoubtedly innovative, the true star of this coffee is the exceptional quality of the beans themselves. Grown at elevations between 1900-2300 MASL in the Sidama region, these mixed Ethiopia Heirloom varietals (774110 and 74158) showcase the best of what Ethiopian coffee has to offer.

Presta Coffee's commitment to quality and innovation shines through in their partnership with farmer Faysel Abdosh and the Gera Agnea Washing Station. This collaboration ensures that the unique terroir of the Keramo microclimate is captured and enhanced through careful processing and roasting.
