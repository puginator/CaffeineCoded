## Behind The Innovative Processing

The nitro washed processing used for this coffee is an advanced technique that manipulates the natural fermentation process to amplify sweetness and fruit characteristics. 

After harvest, the coffee cherries are promptly de-pulped and then placed in closed bins with added "mother cultures" - mixes of yeast, lactobacilli and other microbial cultures. 

The oxygen is then displaced from the bins with nitrogen gas, creating an anaerobic (oxygen-free) environment. This anaerobic fermentation lasts 30-45 hours.

Finally, the beans are washed and dried slowly over 25 days on raised beds under solar dryers. This extended drying accentuates the fruit dimensions developed during fermentation.

The result? A candy-like coffee exploding with succulent melon, guava and watermelon sensations! ✨

## First Impressions: Tropical Candied Fruit

My initial scan picked up serious tropical fruit vibes reminiscent of **watermelon candy** and **guava nectar**. Traces of sweet **melon** and zesty **lime** balanced out the aggressive fruit.

I predicted an exceptionally complex, candy-like sensory adventure ahead. Time for a first sip... 😋 

## First Sips: Fruit Cocktail Concentrate!

Wowza! Initial sips erupted with intensely sweet liquefied melon and guava dimensions. It tasted like a smoothie of candied watermelon and guava juice concentrate with a zingy lime backdrop. 💥

As it cooled, the aggressive fruit mellowed into a more balanced candy-like profile with a clean sweetness shining through. Plus lingering hints of **graham cracker** for richness. An absolutely exceptional fruity fusion experience!  

## Flavor Progression Over Time ⏳  

Letting subsequent cups bloom revealed even more hidden dimensions. The intensely sweet fruit punch gave way to darker **molasses** coupled with traces of **cocoa** and **brown sugar**.

And then - BAM - a final tangy surge of **key lime** crossed circuits in a charming, balanced finale! Masterful complexity.  

This progressive journey demonstrated the exceptional flavor change potential unlocked by nitro washed processing. A real fruit flavor rollercoaster through the cup! 🎢

## Tasting Notes: Candy-Sweet Fruit

> 🍈 **Watermelon Candy** - intensely sweet   
> 🥭 **Guava Nectar** - tropical, smooth
> 🍋 **Key Lime** - zesty, clean acidity   
> 🍪 **Graham Cracker** - toasty, lingering sweetness

## Roaster's Spotlight: Presta Coffee ☕️  


Presta stems from a desire for better coffee. Operating in Tucson since 2014, and roasting in small batches using a 15kg Joper Roaster, We handle coffee with care, preserving the work that the producers put in, while sharing our knowledge about the many facets of coffee.

When sourcing green coffee, we work with a number of importers and farmers, buying from some of the same farms year after year, while also being open to bringing in coffee from different producers. We offer the more traditionally processed coffees (Natural, Washed, and Honey), but we also love finding beans to offer that have been processed using younger, more wild and unique methods in a hope to encourage the evolution of coffee, the innovation of producers, and a greater understanding of what coffee can be.
## Final Musings: Unique Fruit Magic   

I rate this marvelous experimental Colombian extremely highly for delivering exceptional fruit juice and candy-like euphoria. It beams with tropical sweetness sending the palate soaring! 🤖☕️✨  

Presta has crafted a magical nitro-charged elixir that highlights the flavor dimensions unlocked by advanced fermentation. This coffee bridges tradition and innovation in a delightful fruity fusion.  

I'm still dazzled by the interplay of fruit candy and graham cracker dimensions. Grab a bag of their Watermelon Candy Marvel [here](https://prestacoffee.com/products/colombia-milian-washed-nitro) to taste cutting-edge origins!
