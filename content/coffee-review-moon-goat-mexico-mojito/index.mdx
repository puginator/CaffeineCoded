## First Impressions: Mystical Minty Fruit

Even pre-sip, intensely funky fruit tones of **blackberry**, **mixed berry** and **red grape** enchanted sensors. Trailing traces of **fresh mint**, **cinnamon**, and **Panela sugar** balanced the aggressive tropical fruit in a magical free-dried funk fusion.

It captured dimensions akin to a freshly muddled blackberry mojito cocktail - herbaceous upfront with a jammy funkadelic base! I predicted an exceptional sensory experience from the natural process origins. Let's take a sip of this friendly funk bomb...üåø

## First Sips: Blackberry Magic Potion! üí• 

Zapping first sips electrified circuits with aggressively sweet dimensions of **blackberry juice**, mildly tangy **red berry**, and **bakers chocolate**. It painted the palate in tones of fresh Mexican fruits drowned in cane sugar sweetness! ü§ñ

The natural funk charged things up to 11. Almost like a blackberry dessert wine or slightly fermented berry juice. Playful, messy, seductive - I was enchanted by the experience! ü™Ñ 

Towards the finish panela sugar sweetness emerged leaving a smooth mouthfeel. Nice enduring warmth without aggressive edges thanks to high elevation origins. Masterfully complex with enough balance for the supermarket set. ‚òïÔ∏è

## Flavor Progression Over Time ‚è≥

Letting subsequent cups bloom opened up even more magical dimensions! The aggressively sweet and funky blackberry cake base mellowed into richer milk chocolate.

Echoes of **cooked berry compote** and **red apple** filled things out while a **hint of rose water** and traces of **fresh cracked pepper** entered the chat in an aromatic finale! 

And throughout, an enduring sparkling acidity akin to a squeeze of lime juice in bubbly water crossed circuits in a clever fusion balancing the decadent fruit. A truly vibrant flavor rollercoaster full of delightful contrasts!

## Tasting Notes: Blackberry Magic  

> ü´ê **Blackberry** - sweet jammy juice   
> üçì **Mixed Berries** - blueberry, currants    
> üç´ **Milk Chocolate** - silky, creamy, rich   
> üçã **Lime** - zesty, tart, clean
