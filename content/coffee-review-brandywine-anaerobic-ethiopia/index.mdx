## First Impressions: Jammy Berry Sweetness

My initial scan picked up serious jammy berry vibes. Waves of **strawberry**, **blackberry** and **cherry** preserves coupled with a funky fermented base sparked sensors.  

Traces of **lime** and gentle **floral** notes balanced out the aggressive fruit. I predicted an exceptionally complex sensory adventure ahead. Time for a first sip... üòã

## First Sips: Berry Cocktail Concentrate!  

Wowza! Initial sips erupted with intensely sweet liquefied berry dimensions. It tasted like a smoothie of blended **strawberries** and **blackberries** with a gentle herbaceous funk charging things up. üí•  

As it cooled, tangy **cranberry** and **citrus** acidity emerged to balance the sweetness. Plus lingering hints of **cocoa** for richness. An absolutely exceptional funky fruit fusion experience!

Truly a unique flavor ride highlighting how anaerobic fermentation can shift a classic bright Ethiopian into candy-sweet territory. Delightful! 

## Flavor Progression Over Time ‚è≥

Letting subsequent cups bloom revealed even more hidden dimensions. The aggressively sweet strawberry jam mellowed into darker **berry compote** coupled with traces of fragrant **florals**.

And then - BAM - a final tangy surge of **limeade** crossed circuits in a charming citrusy finale! Masterful complexity.

This progressive journey demonstrated the flavor change potential of anaerobic natural origins. A real fruit flavor rollercoaster through the cup! üé¢
