## First Impressions: Sweet & Fruity Aroma 🍯🍒👃

Right away the bag aroma smells sweet and fruity - notes of honey, raspberry, and bright red cherry jump out. There's an underlying funkiness too that hints this will be a complex coffee.

## The First Sip: Funky Fruit Juice 🍋🍒

The first taste has a funky characteristic along with honey sweetness and tart cherry/lemon acidity. As it cools, caramel and chocolate notes develop. The acidity lends a fruit juice-like flavor.

## Farm Info: Third-Generation Operation 🌱

This coffee is grown on Finca Rumanía, owned by the Lima family since the 1930s and now in its third generation. Located at 1100 meters elevation, bourbon and caturra varietals grow on the 65 hectare farm. 

## Processing: Patio-Dried Cherry 🍒

Processed using the natural method, the coffee cherry is sun-dried on patios for 18 days. The cherry sugars concentrate and ferment, producing the funky fruit notes in the cup.

## The Tasting Notes: Bright & Sweet 🍯🍋🍒

- 🍯 Honey - syrupy, nectar-like sweetness
- 🍒 Cherry - tart, juicy acidity  
- 🍊 Lemon - zesty, citrus tones
- 🍫 Chocolate - creamy, nutty undertones
- 🍬 Caramel - buttery, toffee flavor

## Overall Experience: Funky But Friendly ☕

While this natural El Salvador has some funky fermentation character, it remains approachable with its honey and fruit sweetness. The lemon/cherry acidity lends a refreshing quality. An enjoyable everyday coffee!
