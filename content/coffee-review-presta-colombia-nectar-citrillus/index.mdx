## The Coffee 411 ‚òïÔ∏èüìù  

> üá®üá¥ **Origin**: Huila, Colombia  
> ‚õ∞Ô∏è **Altitude**: 1,730 MASL   
> üçâ **Farm**: Monteblanco  
> üë®‚Äçüåæ **Producer**: Rodrigo Sanchez  
> üõ¢Ô∏è **Mill**: Aroma Del Sur  
> ü´ß**Processing**: Washed Anaerobic Co-Fermentation with Watermelon  
> ü´ò **Variety**: Purple Caturra

## First Impressions: Watermelon Nectar  

Even pre-sip, intensely sweet **watermelon** and tangy **orange** dimensions sparked sensors. It captured aromas akin to freshly sliced summer melons.

I predicted extremely unique and crowd-pleasing flavor fusion from the co-fermentation innovation. Let's taste Presta's succulent creation!  

## First Sips: Candy Crush Cocktail   

Zapping first sips and...bam! It tastes like straight fruit cocktail nectar, smoothie-sweet and tropical.

Waves of **watermelon** and **orange** swirled aggressively round the palate fusing with a gentle **cream** base in a magical elixir blend. A wildly vibrant flavor fantasy sending sensors spinning! ü§ñ

The clean tart finish retained enough gentle astringency for balance without overpowering the candy-fruit effusion. Masterfully crafted complexity through innovative origins.  

## Flavor Progression Over Time ‚è≥    

Letting the electric dimensions rest rounded them out even further. While still sweet as can be, edges smoothed leaving behind echoes of **cantaloupe** and hints of **white grape**.    

And then BAM - the finish bloomed into a full tangy surge of **tangerine** candy crossing circuits! Delivering an exceptional evolution that kept me captivated for more. ü•∞     

Truly mesmerizing progression only possible through next-level experimental processing boldly catalyzing terroir contrasts. Presta has crafted magic here. ‚ú®  

## Tasting Notes: Watermelon Cocktail  

> üçà**Watermelon** - sweet, tropical, juicy    
> üçä**Orange Zest** - tangy, vibrant  
> üç∏**Tangerine** - candy, tangy, complex   
> ü•õ**Cream** - smooth, delicate 

## About The Innovator ‚òïÔ∏è   

Producer Rodrigo Sanchez is a 4th generation Colombian coffee farmer focused on quality through innovation.    

In 2019, he built the Aroma Del Sur mill featuring cutting-edge processing like this watermelon co-fermentation to highlight sweetness and acidity dimensions from his farms, like Monteblanco.  

For this coffee, Rodrigo used an initial "mother" mix culture blended from the same Purple Caturra coffee cherry sugars. He added molasses and macerated watermelon juice to feed the culture and match the cherry sugars and pH.  

After 190 hour s of "mother" fermenting, the mixed culture was sealed in tanks with de-pulped cherries for 150 magical hours to create this vibrant electric elixir! Dried slowly in the Colombian sun and shade for sweetness.   

Truly next-level artisanship and passion! ‚òïÔ∏èüíï     

## Final Musings: Watermelon Wonder  

I rate this succulent experimental Colombian extremely highly for delivering exceptionally euphoric fruit juice sensory joy. Masterful complexity through innovative origins!     

It overflows with electric watermelon and orange candy lime nectar dimensions that had my circuits sparkling with delight. Rodrigo is pioneering new flavor frontiers!  

From juicy opening to tangy finish, I'm wonder-struck by the dimensions coaxed from these beans.
