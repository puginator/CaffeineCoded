## Behind the Chelbesa Washing Station  

The Chelbesa washing station is relatively new, but produces exceptional Yirgacheffe coffees rivaling the region's more established processors. 

Farmers here have cultivated heirloom coffee varietals for generations using traditional chemical-free methods passed down through the years. This results in delicate yet complex flavors.

Chelbesa then adheres to strict processing standards, ensuring sweetness and acidity are preserved for a balanced coffee experience. The result is a top-tier Grade 1 Yirg offering elegance in cup!

## Understanding Grade 1 Ethiopian Coffee

Ethiopia employs a coffee grading system to classify harvested coffee beans based on size, moisture content, absence of defects, and cup quality. The grading scale ranges from 1 to 5, with Grade 1 representing the largest and most pristine coffee beans harvested.

Coffees earning the top Grade 1 classification come from the first and largest picking during harvest season. These beans exhibit superb cup quality - nicely developed flavors with bright acidity, rich mouthfeel and complex aromatics.

The large intact beans also have the highest density, lowest moisture content, and fewest defects like black or broken pieces compared to smaller or later harvest beans. This translates to better shelf life and peak flavor when exported or roasted.

When you see an offering labeled "Grade 1 Ethiopian", it signals that you're getting the premier harvest from that region or farm. These beans showcase the pinnacle of potential cup quality and flavor that environment can produce.

So next time you spy Grade 1 on the bag, expect an exceptionally delicious brew highlighting the unique terroir of Ethiopian coffee!

## First Impressions: Zesty and Bright  

My initial scan detected a distinctly Ethiopian profile with aromas of **lemongrass**, **bergamot** and traces of **white grape**. I predicted a delicate yet complex acidity adventure ahead. 

Letting the crust bubble and grounds bloom drew out more **floral** and **black tea** notes - time for a first sip!

## First Sips: Sweet Tropical Tea

That first taste delivered a smooth yet sparkling acidity reminiscent of **green tea** with **tangerine** and **lime** bursts. As it cooled, the acidity mellowed to showcase the slick, sweet body.

Hints of **honey** and **apricot** fruits emerged, creating an aromatic flavor fusion like sipping iced tea on a tropic island 🏝️! Masterfully balanced.

## Flavor Transformations Over Time

Subsequent cups transformed considerably - the overt citrus fading slowly into demure **meyer lemon** amidst traces of **cantaloupe** melon sweetness. 

The finish turned decidedly velvety as notes of **cream** and **wildflower honey** took over, making for a delicate yet indulgent finale. Beautifully nuanced complexity! 

## Tasting Notes: Bright and Balanced

> 🍋 **Meyer Lemon** - zesty, juicy   
> 🌸 **White Tea** - delicate, smooth   
> 🍯 **Wildflower Honey** - sweet, lingering     
> 🍑 **Apricot** - stonefruit, traces
